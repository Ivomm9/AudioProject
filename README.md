This project was made by Ivo Montes, Sergi Gantzer and Pau Mora. The following
sound elements have been implemented:
# General Ambient and Environmental Sounds: #
- Birds Flock 
- Farm ambience
- Waterfall
- Radio music
- Vehicle with Doppler effect while they move.
# If you reach the Tippies: #
- Tribal music
- Campfire sound
# Player Interaction Sounds: #
- Footsteps: Dynamic footstep sounds based on terrain type (grass, dirt, wood, rock, mud, water and sand).
- Wind rush effect: Triggered when the player moves at high speed while flying.(use SHIFT while flying)
# This is made using the following:
- Keyframe-based event sounds (footsteps)
- Triggers: Footsteps and wind effects triggered based on speed and location.
- Mixers: Separate audio groups for environment and SFX
- Audio quality: Optimized with different formats and looped perfectly
# Controls:
- WASD To move
- F To fly
- Shift to Sprint and fly faster
- Escape to Pause
